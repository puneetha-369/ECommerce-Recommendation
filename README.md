**Product Recommendation System**

This project focuses on building a Product Recommendation System to enhance customer shopping experiences by suggesting products based on their preferences and historical behavior. Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze customer-product interactions to predict relevant recommendations effectively.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing customer purchase data for analysis.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Using customer-product interactions to generate recommendations.
3. **Content-Based Filtering:** Leveraging product attributes for personalized suggestions.
4. **Hybrid Approach:** Combining collaborative and content-based techniques for improved accuracy.

**Objectives:**
- To improve user engagement through personalized product suggestions.
- To boost sales and customer satisfaction by targeting relevant product recommendations.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-learn and Surprise for implementing recommendation algorithms, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

**Outcome:** This system provides actionable insights and high-quality recommendations, assisting businesses in making data-driven decisions while enhancing user satisfaction.
